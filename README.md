# FUT Performance Prediction Model
## Project Overview
This project develops a supervised machine learning regression model to predict future FC (FIFA/EA Sports FC) player ratings and market values based on real-world performance statistics (goals, assists, tackles, etc.) from previous seasons. Will involve an interactive UI where users will be able to enter potential season statistics and determine predicted future ratings & performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Python:** Primary language for data processing and model training.
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn (or XGBoost/LightGBM).
- **Web App:** (To be determined: React/JavaScript Frontend and Flask/Python Backend).

## Data Sources
Historical FIFA player data and corresponding real-world match performance metrics.
